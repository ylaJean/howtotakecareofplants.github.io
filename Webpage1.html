	<h2>1. Choose a correct pot</h2>
				
		A pot should have a hole in the bottom so that the excess water can drain. Thus, the plants will not drown. 
		
	<h2>2. Use a Good soil </h2>
	 
		Think what kind of soil does your plant need. Soil outside your home is not enough for your plants. Because plants need a good soil.
		
	<h2>3. Watering should not be too much and not too little. </h2>
	 
		To tell if you're wattering your plants way too much or to little feel the soil.  If the dirt feels dry and crumbly its time to water. 
		
		BE CAREFUL OF THE AMOUNT OF WATER.
		
	<h2>4. Give them light</h2> 	
	 
		Plants need at least some sun to thrive and Indoor plants really need sunlight. Thus, place your indoor plants in the windowsills or place
		
		that the sunlight can touch your plants. 
		
	<h2>5. Keep the pets away	</h2>
	 
		If you have a pet. Place your Indoor plants where your pet can't access. 
		
	<h2>6. Learn About your plant </h2>
	 
		Take time to learn about what type of plant you're caring  for. Learn how much sun it likes, or how much shade. Learm if it needs to be 
		
		watered every day, or if it can go as long as two weeks without water.
